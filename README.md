# Microsoft-Professional-Program-in-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Microsoft consulted data scientists and the companies that employ them to identify the core skills they need to be successful. This informed the curriculum used to teach key functional and technical skills, combining highly rated online courses with hands-on labs, concluding in a final capstone project.

The program consists of 11 required courses to complete the program. Each of the courses is hosted on edX, an online learning platform.
